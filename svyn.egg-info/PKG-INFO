Description: svyn
        ====
        
        svyn is an svn helper. It allows you to specify some typical repository
        information in a config file and simplifies several common commands based on
        that information. If you typically branch from a shared trunk, or operate on
        several different repositories and would like a couple shortcuts, svyn might
        be for you. Right now branching and listing/searching branches are
        the entirety of its powers. Future features may include support for file history
        information and repository introspection.
        
        .svynrc
        -------
        
        The .svynrc file is in .ini format. It can handle multiple sections. Each section should specify
        four variables:
        * ``repo_url``: However you want to represent the base URL for your repo
        * ``root_dir``: What you think of as the root dir of your repo
        * ``branches_dir``: The path to where your branches are stored.
        * ``copy_source_dir``: The source directory from which branches will be copied.
        * ``release_dir``: The directory where numbered releases are stored
        
        The ``branches``, ``copy_source_dir``, ``release_dir`` should be relative to the
        ``root_dir``. The ``root_dir`` is essentially concatenated with the ``repo_url`` and
        then with one of the prior variables to generate the full address for svn.
        
        Example conf section
        --------------------
        
        ::
        
            [default]
            repo_url = svn+ssh://svn/svnroot
            root_dir = some/project/source
            branches_dir = branches
            copy_source_dir = trunk
        
        In this case, ``svyn branch foo`` would use
        ``svn+ssh://svn/svnroot/some/project/source/trunk`` as the source for new
        branches, which it would then copy to ``svn+ssh://svn/svnroot/some/project/source/branches/foo``
        
        The section to be searched for the variables can be set for any svyn command
        with the ``-c`` flag, so ``svyn -c bar_section branch`` would then use variables
        from ``[bar_section]`` in the ``.svynrc`` file.
